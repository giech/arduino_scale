# arduino_scale

This repository contains the Arduino [sketch](arduino_scale.ino) and the supporting [library](libs) as well as the [schematics](schematics) for a bathroom scale with auto power-off using a 4-digit 7-segment display and the HX711 and MAX7219 chips.

The code depends on the [HX711 library](https://github.com/bogde/HX711), and on my [modification](https://github.com/giech/LedControl) of the LedControl library, which allows an easier way to display characters on the display, though hopefully my [pull request](https://github.com/wayoda/LedControl/pull/13) will be approved to integrate it into the original one.
